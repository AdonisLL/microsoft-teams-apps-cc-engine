Want to take a stab at extending Company Communicator? Here are some ideas: 

## Extend the compose experience
* Allow file attachments in the message. The app currently provides basic rich formatting of message body.
* Allow existing messages as templates for new message creation.

## Message metrics
Export actionable data on message replies, acknowledgments, reactions in detail.

## New message types
* **Surveys/polls:** Send surveys and polls for employees to gather NPS on new initiatives or gather quick feedback on organization activities.
